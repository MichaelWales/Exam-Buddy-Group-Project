This is an app designed to be an educational hub to help students in the primary or secondary education system with interactive learning. A client can customise the content including revision material, test topics, test questions amongst other things. The app will generate a visual representation of the student's scores in different topics to inspire learning and encourage continued development.

The brief is as follows:

## Educational App
The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive browser applications that display information in a fun and interesting way. Your task is to make an a Minimum Viable Product or prototype to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app.

## MVP
A user should be able to:

- View some educational content on a particular topic.
- Be able to interact with the page to move through different sections of content.

## Possible Extensions
- Use an API to bring in content or a database to store information.
- Use charts or maps to display your information to the page.
